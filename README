QR Code Plasmoid
----------------

The QR Code Plasmoid is a plasmoid for KDE 4 that enables the user to quickly
export some selected text in the form of a QR Code. 
The purpose is to be able to quickly copy and paste text from the computer to
a mobile phone or other devices.

This plasmoid requires the libqrencode library and doesn't use any web services
so it can work offline.

The best way to use it is to add the Plasmoid to your task bar, not directly
on the desktop.


Features:
---------

- Encode text into a QR Code with a single click
- The text can be taken from the current selection or clipboard
- Save the QR code as image file by clicking on it


Requirements
------------

- libqrencode: http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.en.html


Compile and install
-------------------

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install
kbuildsyscoca4

After this the plasmoid should become visible in the list of Plasmoids.


Usage
-----

Select some text in any application, then click the plasmoid's icon.
A popup will appear with the matching QR Code.

It is possible to modify the application's behavior in the plasmoid's
configuration dialog.
