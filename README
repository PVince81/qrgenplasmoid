QR Code Plasmoid
----------------

The QR Code Plasmoid is a plasmoid for KDE4 that enables the user to quickly
export some selected text in the form of a QR Code. The QR Code can then
be scanned by a mobile phone or other device to retrieve the information.

This plasmoid requires the libqrencode library and doesn't use any web services
so it can work offline.

The best way to use it is to add the Plasmoid to your task bar, not directly
on the desktop.


Requirements
------------
   libqrencode: http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.en.html


Compile and install
-------------------

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
sudo make install
kbuildsyscoca4

After this the plasmoid should become visible in the list of Plasmoids.
